## 🗃️ Database Design

### Entities & Key Fields

- **Users**
  - `id`: Unique identifier
  - `username`: User's login name
  - `email`: Contact email
  - `password`: Hashed password
  - `role`: Guest or Host

- **Properties**
  - `id`: Unique property ID
  - `title`: Name of the property
  - `description`: Details about the property
  - `location`: City or address
  - `host_id`: Linked to a user (host)

- **Bookings**
  - `id`: Booking ID
  - `user_id`: Linked to the guest
  - `property_id`: Linked to the property
  - `start_date`: Booking start
  - `end_date`: Booking end

- **Reviews**

- A **payment** is tied to a **booking**.


## 🧩 Feature Breakdown

**1. User Management**  
Allows users to register, log in, and manage profiles. Depending on their role, users can either book properties or list them for rent.

**2. Property Management**  
Hosts can add, update, or remove property listings, set availability, pricing, and upload images.

**3. Booking System**  
Enables guests to check availability and book properties securely. Confirms and tracks booking details for both parties.

**4. Reviews and Ratings**  
After each stay, guests can leave feedback. Ratings influence property visibility and trust.

**5. Payment Integration**  
Processes payments securely via an integrated payment gateway, ensuring smooth transactions.

**6. Search and Filter Functionality**  
Users can search properties by location, price, and date. Filters help tailor the results.

**7. Admin Dashboard (optional)**  
Admins can monitor platform activity, moderate content, and resolve issues.

## 🔐 API Security

Security is a foundational aspect of the Airbnb Clone project. Protecting user data, ensuring safe transactions, and maintaining platform integrity are all dependent on robust backend API security. Below are the key measures we will implement:

### Key Security Measures

- **Authentication**:  
  We will use secure token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to verify the identity of users accessing the system. This ensures that only registered users can access protected routes.

- **Authorization**:  
  Role-based access control will ensure users can only perform actions relevant to their permissions. For example, only hosts can list properties, and only guests can book them.

- **Rate Limiting**:  
  To prevent brute-force attacks and abuse, we’ll implement rate limiting on API endpoints. This restricts the number of requests a user can make in a given timeframe.

- **Input Validation and Sanitization**:  
  All incoming data will be validated and sanitized to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).

- **HTTPS Encryption**:  
  All data transfers between client and server will be encrypted using HTTPS to prevent data interception.

- **Secure Payment Processing**:  
  Integration with a trusted third-party payment gateway will handle all financial transactions, ensuring PCI compliance and fraud prevention.

### Why Security Matters

- **User Data Protection**:  
  Email addresses, passwords, and personal booking details must remain private and secure to build user trust.

- **Platform Integrity**:  
  Unauthorized access or manipulation could undermine the system’s functionality and reputation.

- **Financial Safety**:  
  Payment data is especially sensitive; any breach could lead to fraud, legal issues, and loss of user confidence.

- **Compliance**:  
  Implementing proper security measures ensures compliance with data protection laws and industry best practices.

By integrating these security protocols early in development, we ensure a safe and scalable application for all users.
## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a set of practices and tools used to automate the process of integrating code changes, testing, and deploying applications. In this project, CI/CD pipelines will help us maintain high code quality, catch bugs early, and release features faster and more reliably.

### Why It Matters

- **Continuous Integration**: Ensures that every code change is automatically tested and merged, reducing integration issues and promoting collaboration.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Automates the release of code to production or staging environments, making deployments faster and less error-prone.
- **Reliability**: Automated testing and deployment help catch issues before they affect users.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces manual work and allows developers to focus on building features rather than managing deployments.

### Tools We May Use

- **GitHub Actions**: To automate testing, linting, and deployments directly from the GitHub repository.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application and ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- **Heroku / Vercel / AWS**: For deploying frontend and backend services.
- **PostgreSQL**: For database consistency and automated migrations during deployment.

CI/CD will ensure that every push to the repository is automatically validated and deployed when appropriate, supporting a smooth and scalable development process.
