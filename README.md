- Build both frontend and backend components in a modular, scalable way

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- HTML5, CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- React
- React Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- React Native (for mobile)

### Backend:
- Python
- Django
- PostgreSQL
- REST APIs
- Shell scripting
- Microservices Architecture
- DevOps Tools (CI/CD, Docker)

## 📂 Repository Structure (to be updated)

- `/frontend` – Frontend application code
- `/backend` – Backend APIs and services

Objective: Understand the various roles within the project team.

## 👥 Team Roles

In a full-stack development project like the Airbnb Clone, team members may assume specific roles based on their strengths and learning goals. Each role plays a crucial part in delivering a robust, functional product. Below are the primary roles and their responsibilities:

### 🧠 Project Manager (PM)
Responsible for planning, coordinating tasks, setting milestones, and ensuring timely delivery of project components. Acts as the bridge between technical and non-technical team members.

### 💻 Frontend Developer
Focuses on implementing the user interface using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React. Responsible for building responsive, accessible, and user-friendly components that mirror Airbnb’s design principles.

### 🛠️ Backend Developer
Handles server-side logic and integrates the frontend with backend services. Uses technologies like Python and Django to build scalable APIs, authentication systems, and business logic.

### 🗃️ Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs and manages the database architecture. Ensures data integrity, performance optimization, and security using tools like PostgreSQL.

### 🔗 API Integration Specialist
Works on connecting the backend with third-party services (e.g., payment gateways, geolocation APIs). Ensures seamless and secure data communication.

### 🧪 QA Tester
Tests the application for bugs, usability issues, and responsiveness across devices. Ensures that each component meets quality standards before deployment.

### 🚀 DevOps Engineer
Automates builds, testing, and deployment pipelines. Uses tools like Docker and CI/CD workflows to ensure smooth and repeatable deployments.

### 📱 Mobile Developer
Implements the mobile version of the Airbnb Clone using React Native. Ensures performance and compatibility across iOS and Android platforms.

### 🛡️ Security Specialist
Focuses on securing the app against vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and unauthorized access. Monitors logs, implements security patches, and performs audits.

## 🧰 Technology Stack

This Airbnb Clone project leverages a modern full-stack architecture to build scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly applications. Below is a breakdown of the technologies used and their roles:

### 🐍 Django
A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. In this project, Django is used to build the backend logic, manage authentication, and expose RESTful API endpoints.

### 🐘 PostgreSQL
An open-source relational database management system. PostgreSQL is used to store and manage all persistent data including users, bookings, listings, and reviews.

### ⚛️ React
A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React powers the frontend of the application, enabling dynamic and responsive UI components for seamless user interaction.

### ⚡ TypeScript
A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and developer productivity. Used alongside React for safer and more predictable frontend development.

### 📱 React Native
A framework for building cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript and React. Enables the development of a native mobile version of the Airbnb Clone for both iOS and Android platforms.

### 🐚 Shell / Bash
Used for scripting and automation, such as setting
